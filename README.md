Quick Start
-----------

* Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).
* From the root of the app directory, install all the dependencies by running:

        $ make deps

* To run the development server:

        $ make serve

  This will start a server on http://localhost:3000.  It will watch for changes
  in files and reload automatically.

* To build a minified app:

        $ make
